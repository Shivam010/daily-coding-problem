Problem: &nbsp;`#006`

This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of
each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an
XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has
an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which
returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you
have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts
between nodes and memory addresses.
