This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a `2D
array`. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there
is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any
currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that
currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.

  a b c
a 0 2 1
b 2 0 5
c 1 3 0

1c
c-a 1c - 1a
a-b 1a - 2b
b-c 2b - 10c
10c
