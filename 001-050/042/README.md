This problem was asked by Google.

Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns
a subset of S that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot be made, then return
null.

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in
the list are positive.

For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1]
since it sums up to 24.
