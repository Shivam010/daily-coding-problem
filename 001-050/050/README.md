This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an
integer and each internal node is one of `'+', '−', '∗', or '/'`.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
```
You should return `45`, as it is `(3 + 2) * (4 + 5)`.
