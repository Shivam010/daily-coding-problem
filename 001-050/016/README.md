This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last `N order ids` in a
log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be
smaller than or equal to N. You should be as efficient with time and space as
possible.
