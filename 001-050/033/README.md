This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of
numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle
numbers.

For example, given the sequence `[2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5]`, your algorithm should
print out:

```
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
```
