_Date: September 22, 2020_<br>
This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the
intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the
node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node
objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and
constant space.
