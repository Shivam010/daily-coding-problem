This problem was asked by Google.

We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of
inversions it has. Two elements `A[i]` and `A[j]` form an inversion if `A[i] >
A[j]` but `i < j`. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.

Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than
`O(N^2)` time.

You may assume each element in the array is distinct.

For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]` has
three inversions: `(2, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(4, 3)`. The array `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.
