_Date: October 21, 2020_<br>
This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of
the array.

For example, given the array `[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]`, the maximum sum would
be `137`, since we would take elements `42, 14, -5, and 86`.

Given the array `[-5, -1, -8, -9]`, the maximum sum would be `0`, since we would
not take any elements.

Do this in `O(N)` time.
