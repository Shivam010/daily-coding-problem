This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one
integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13],
return 19.

Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.
