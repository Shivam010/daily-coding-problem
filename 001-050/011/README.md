This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of
all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a
prefix.

For example, given the query string `de` and the set of strings `[dog, deer,
deal]`, return `[deer, deal]`.

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to
speed up queries.
