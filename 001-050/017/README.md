This problem was asked by Google.

Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents:

    dir
        subdir1
        subdir2
            file.ext

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a
sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file `file.ext`.

The string
`"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"`
represents:

    dir
        subdir1
            file1.ext
            subsubdir1
        subdir2
            subsubdir2
                file2.ext

The directory `dir` contains two sub-directories `subdir1` and `subdir2`.
`subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and an empty second-level sub-directory
`subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a second-level sub-directory `subsubdir2`
containing a file `file2.ext`.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to
a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the
longest absolute path is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`, and its length is
32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the
length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If
there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.
