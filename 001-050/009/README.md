This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of
non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1,
1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
