This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in
chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you
could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you
can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could
buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.
