> _People find their paths in the strangest of ways._

On _`September 03, 2020`_, I found this website [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/), where you can subscribe
to a newsletter and get one problem a day. I like the initiative: Solving one problem every day.

Also, after college, the daily job cycle began, which led to my breakup with competitive programming. But I wanted to start
solving problems again to keep it up, but could never begin.

So, I decided to subscribe the newsletter and to solve one problem every day. <br>
Since then I have solved _**`#56 problems`**_.
You can find the problems and solutions in their respective directories [here](https://github.com/Shivam010/daily-coding-problem).

Solutions are mainly in _**C++ and Golang**_, and some problems may
also have _**Python**_ solution too, depending on what is asked in question.
