> _People find their paths in the strangest of ways._

On _`September 03, 2020`_, I found this website [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/), where you can subscribe
to a newsletter and get one problem a day. I like the initiative: Solving one problem every day.

Also, after college, the daily job cycle began, which led to my breakup with competitive programming. But I wanted to start
solving problems again to keep it up, but could never begin.

So, I decided to subscribe the newsletter and to solve one problem every day. <br>
Since then I have solved _**`#{{.Solved}} problems`**_.
You can find the problems and solutions in their directories: [here](https://github.com/Shivam010/daily-coding-problem).

Solutions are mainly in _**C++ and Golang**_, and some problems may
also have _**Python**_ solution too, depending on what is asked in question.

> _Checkout my blog post on my habit of solving a problem daily [here](https://medium.com/coderbyte/solving-a-problem-every-day-a6de133a9254)_

_Want to join me? or Just need to stay upto date? <br>
**Start watching this repository or connect with me.**_

_And if you want to **review my solutions** or want to **add something**, I am open for accepting PRs, code reviews.

Anything you feel that needs correction._
