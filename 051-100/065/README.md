This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a `N by M` matrix of numbers, print out the matrix in a clockwise spiral.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
```

You should print out the following:

```
1
2
3
4
5
10
15
20
19
18
17
16
