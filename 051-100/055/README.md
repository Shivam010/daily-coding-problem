_Date: October 27, 2020_<br>
This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

- `shorten(url)`, which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric
string, such as `zLg6wl`.
- `restore(short)`, which expands the shortened string into the original url. If
no such shortened string exists, return null.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
