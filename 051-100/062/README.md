This problem was asked by Facebook.

There is an `N by M` matrix of zeroes. Given `N and M`, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the
top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a `2 by 2` matrix, you should return `2`, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

Right, then down Down, then right Given a `5 by 5` matrix, there are `70` ways to get to the bottom-right.
