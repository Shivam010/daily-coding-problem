This problem was asked by Google.

Implement an _**LRU (Least Recently Used) caching**_ system. It should be able to be
initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

`set(key, value)`: sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache
and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used
item.

`get(key)`: gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null. Each
operation should run in `O(1)` time.

**Solution(s)**:<br>

    • [Golang](go/code.go)<br>
