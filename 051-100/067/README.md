This problem was asked by Google.

Implement an _**LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching**_ system. It should be able to be
initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

`set(key, value)`: sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache
and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least frequently used
item. If there is a tie, then the least recently used key should be removed.

`get(key)`: gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null. Each
operation should run in `O(1)` time.
