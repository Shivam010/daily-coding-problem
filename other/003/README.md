This problem was asked by Hackerearth.

You are given an array `A` of integers and two values `O` and `E`. You have to 
make all possible non-empty subsets of `A` while following these conditions:

1. If the subset made is of an even length, then you add `E` to every value 
of the subset and then multiply all of them. You then divide this resultant 
value by `O`.
2. If the subset is of an odd length, then you add `O` to every value of the 
subset and then multiply all of them. You then divide this resultant value 
by `E`.

Since the values in `A` are large, take the `Modulo` in all the operations 
with `10^9 + 7`.

Write a program to determine the XOR of all of the values that will come 
after applying the above operations with `Modulo`.

**Constraints:**<br/>
`1 <= O and E <= 10^9` <br/>
`1 <= Size of array <= 16` <br/>
`1 <= Array elements <= 10^9` <br/>
