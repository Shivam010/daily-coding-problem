This problem was asked by Turvo.

You are given 5 functions:

`gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`

`A(x)` is the number of `i` where `1 <= i <= x` and `gcd(i, x) = 1`

`B(x)` is the sum of `A(d)` for all `d` that divides the number `x`

`C(x)` is the sum of exponents of each prime in prime factorization of `B(x)`

`D(x) is the sum of C(i) where `1 <= i <= x`

Now, you are given an integer `N`. Your task is to find the value of `D(N)`.
